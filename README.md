# Adventure Sports Website (Travel Domain)

This project is part of a group mini-project for college.  
The website is themed around adventure sports and travel.

My contribution to this project is the **animation section**, where I worked on adding motion, hover effects, and scrolling text using HTML and CSS.

---

## What I Worked On
- Animated product section using CSS keyframes  
- Floating animation for the main element  
- Hover effect that switches between two images  
- Scrolling marquee text  
- Background color change on hover  

All animations are done using **HTML5 and CSS3 only** (no JavaScript).

## Target Users
